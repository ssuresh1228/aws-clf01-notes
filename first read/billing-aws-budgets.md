- **key insights:** 
	- **WS Budgets** gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount.
	- You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Reservation alerts are supported for Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon OpenSearch reservations.
	- The AWS Budgets Dashboard is your hub for creating, tracking and inspecting your budgets. From the AWS Budgets Dashboard, you can create, edit, and manage your budgets, as well as view the status of each of your budgets. You can also view additional details about your budgets, such as high-level variance analysis and a budget criteria summary.
	- Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. Budget alerts can be sent via email and/or Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic.
