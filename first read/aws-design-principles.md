# AWS design principles
---
- <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>scalability</span>
	- **horizontally**: increase in number of resources 
	- **vertically**: increase in hardware specs of an individual resource 
- <span style='color:#fa8231'>disposable resources instead of fixed servers</span>
	- **instantiating compute resources**
		- automate setup of new resources, their config, and code 
	- **infrastructure as code**
		- make your whole infra reusable, maintainable, and testable
- <span style='color:#f7b731'>automation</span>
	- **serverless management**
		- focus on code deployment automation. AWS manages management tasks.
	- **infrastructure management/deployment**
		- AWS: auto-handles resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, monitoring. 
			- your focus: resource deployment.
	- **alarms/events**
		- AWS services continuously monitor your resources & initiate events when certain metrics/conditions are met 
- <span style='color:#20bf6b'>loose coupling</span>
	- **well-defined interfaces**
		- Reduce interdependencies, make components communicate via REST APIs.
	- **service discovery**
		- Apps deployed as a set of small services must work without network knowledge:
			- hides complexity, permits infrastructure changes.
	- **asynchronous integration**
		- For components needing only request acknowledgement, not instant response, integrate via a durable storage layer
	- **distributed systems best practices**
		- build apps that handle component failure gracefully 
- <span style='color:#0fb9b1'>services, not servers</span>
	- **managed services**
		- Offer developers building blocks like databases, machine learning, analytics, queuing, search, email, notifications for their apps.
	- **serverless architecture**
		- Build event-driven/synchronous services without server management to reduce operational complexity.
- <span style='color:#2d98da'>databases</span>
	- choose the right DB for each workload
	- **relational DB**
		- strong query language, flexible indexing, integrity controls, and efficient data combination from multiple tables..
			- [[meta-database#AWS RDS|RDS]], [[meta-database#Amazon Aurora|Aurora]], [[meta-database#Amazon Redshift|RedShift]] 
	- **noSQL DB**
		- Trade some relational database abilities for scalable, flexible data models like graphs, key-value pairs, JSON. Enables easier development, improved performance, availability, resilience.
			- [[meta-database#Amazon DynamoDB|DynamoDB]], [[meta-database#AWS DocumentDB|DocumentDB]], [[summary-database#Amazon ElastiCache fold|ElastiCache]],  
	- **data warehouse**
		- specialized type of relational database, which is optimized for analysis and reporting of large amounts of data.
			- [[meta-database#Amazon Redshift|RedShift meta]], [[summary-database#Amazon Redshift fold|RedShift summary]] 
	- **graph DB**
		- uses graph structures for queries 
		- Query: formal request to specific dataset. 
		- Search: allows querying unstructured data.
		- Search service: indexes/searches structured/free text, supports ranking customization, filter faceting, synonyms, stemming.
			- [[meta-database#Amazon Neptune|Neptune meta]], [[summary-database#Amazon Neptune Graph DB fold|Neptune summary]]  
- <span style='color:#3867d6'>managing increasing volumes of data</span> 
	- **data lake**
		- Architectural approach
		- Central data storage: vast, available for categorization, processing, analysis, consumed by various organization groups.
- <span style='color:#8854d0'>removing single points of failure</span>
	- **introducing redundancy on resource failure**
		- <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>standby redundancy</span> 
			- functionality recovers via secondary resource, failover process.
			- Takes time, resource unavailable during recovery
			- Common for stateful components like relational databases
		- <span style='color:#20bf6b'>active redundancy</span> 
			- Requests distributed to redundant compute resources. 
			- if one fails, other resources absorb larger workload share.
	- **detect failure**
		- use health checks and collect logins
	- **durable data storage**
		- <span style='color:#0fb9b1'>synchronous replication</span>
			- acknowledges transaction after durable storage in primary and replicas.
			- Protects data integrity, ideal for primary node failure.
		- <span style='color:#2d98da'>asynchronous replication</span> 
			- Decouples primary node from replicas: introduces replication lag. 
			- Changes on primary node not immediately reflected on replicas.
		- <span style='color:#8854d0'>Quorum-based replication</span>
			- synchronous + asynchronous replication
			- Defines minimum nodes needed for a successful write operation
	- **Automated Multi-Data Center Resilience**
		- use AWS Regions and Availability Zones (Multi-AZ Principle)
	- **Fault Isolation and Traditional Horizontal Scaling** 
		- <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>Shuffle Sharding</span>
			- reduces failures and improves reliability. 
			- Resources divided into shards: each user/request assigned unique shard combo. 
			- If one shard fails, only a small fraction of resource affected. 
			- Isolates faults, prevents system impact. 
			- Efficient scaling by adding more shards. 
			- Alternative to traditional horizontal scaling.
 - <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>optimize for cost</span>
	- **right sizing**
		 - broad range of resource types and configurations for many use cases.
	- **elasticity**
		- save money with AWS by taking advantage of the platform’s elasticity.
	- **Take Advantage of the Variety of Purchasing Options**
		- reserved vs spot instances for discounts 
- <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>caching</span> 
	- **app data caching**
		- store/retrieve information from fast, managed in-memory caches: [[database-elasticache#^1ed1be|ElastiCache]] 
	- **edge caching**
		- Delivers content via nearby infrastructure lowers latency high sustained data rates needed for large objects delivery to end users at scale: [[networking-aws-cloudfront#^00eb30|CloudFront]] 
- <span style='color:#fa8231'>security</span>
	- **Use AWS Features for Defense in Depth** 
		- secure multiple levels of your infrastructure from network down to application and database.
	- **Share Security Responsibility with AWS** – 
		- AWS handles the security OF the Cloud while customers handle security IN the Cloud.
	- **Reduce Privileged Access**  
		- implement the Principle of Least Privilege controls. [[security-identity-compliance-aws-iam#^ab9f15|IAM]] 
	- **Security as Code** 
		- Golden Environment template captures firewall rules, network access controls, internal/external subnets, operating system hardening.
	- **Real-Time Auditing** 
		- implement continuous monitoring and automation of controls on AWS to minimize exposure to security risks.
		- [[monitoring-CloudTrail#^718023|CloudTrail]]
- <span style='color:#f7b731'>cloud architecture for best practices</span>
	- **Decouple your components** 
		- build loosely coupled components for stability if one fails (loose coupling principle). 
		- Supports Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 
			- loosely coupled system components scale better/stably.
	- **Think parallel** 
		- implement parallelization whenever possible  
		- automate processes of your cloud architecture.
	- **Implement elasticity**
		- automate deployment process and streamline config/build process of your architecture. 
		- ensures system can scale in and scale out to meet demand without human intervention
	- **Design for failure**  
		- be a pessimist when designing architectures in the cloud and assumes that the components of your architecture will fail. 
		- reinforces you to always design your cloud architecture to be highly available and fault-tolerant.
