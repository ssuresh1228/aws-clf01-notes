---
- **Scalability:** 
	- Increase resources horizontally or vertically.
- **Disposable resources instead of fixed servers:** 
	- Automate setup, use infrastructure as code.
- **Automation:** 
	- Focus on code deployment automation, let AWS handle management tasks.
- **Loose coupling:** 
	- Reduce interdependencies, use well-defined interfaces and service discovery.
- **Services, not servers:** 
	- Use managed services and serverless architecture to reduce complexity.
- **Databases:** 
	- Choose the right DB for each workload.
- **Managing increasing volumes of data:** 
	- Use a data lake for central storage and analysis.
- **Removing single points of failure:** 
	- Introduce redundancy, detect failure, use durable data storage.
- **Optimize for cost:** 
	- Right size resources, take advantage of elasticity and purchasing options.
- **Caching:** 
	- Use app data caching and edge caching for faster content delivery.
- **Security: **
	- Use AWS features for defense in depth, reduce privileged access, implement security as code.
- **Cloud architecture for best practices:** 
	- Decouple components, think parallel, implement elasticity, design for failure.
